- âš¡ Fun fact: I sort of "hacked" the school in 2nd grade. Then they asked me if I could visit the office of the software maker that my school uses to check on school Chromebooks. I was given a tour there, lunch and I talked to the developers. It's a very nice memory. This was my fun fact! See you later!
